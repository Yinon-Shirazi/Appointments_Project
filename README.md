# Appointments_Project

**This project has been done in collaboration with Swann Thantsin and Nursultan Zhumabaev.**
In this project, we implemented HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL.

This project Allows tenants of a residential building to create an account for their apartment, log into that account and schedule a time slot for them to use the laundry room.

Each account has a user id, password, and contact information for one of the tenants that live in that apartment. Once an account has been created, users can log in and
make their selections or view their upcoming apartments.
The calender is updated to reflect current date and time in EST, so users cannot select past time slots. 
If the user has already selected a time slot, instead of the available time slots, the system displays the date/day/time of the selected time slot for that week,
and gives the user the option to change his mind by canceling his appointment. 
Users can only sign up for a week at a time with the week starting on a Monday and ending on a Sunday. A new weekâ€™s signup becomes available on the Sunday midnight
before the Monday of the new week.
